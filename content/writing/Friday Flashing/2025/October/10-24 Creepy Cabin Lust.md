Notes: "This is my first crossover between my #fridayflashing stories and my other stories, but it won't be the last. This one is just a light crossover, introducing us to Callie's friend and fellow influencer, Hazel, who we will eventually see in #spirit_boxing but so far has only been mentioned."

"Hey every*one*!" Hazel beamed into the camera she held at arm's length. "*TwitchWitch* again we're on another spooky adventure!"  She walked backward down a narrow path toward a cabin surrounded by dense woods.  "Of *course* I'm here with my producer, the original *BooBuster*!" She turned the camera on Lena who was carrying two bags of groceries and a cardboard box of Merlot.

"I didn't even choose that name! You just like that it sounds like 'boob'!" Lena grumbled gently. Hazel's chaotic enthusiasm was the thing Lena loved most about her, and Lena loved a *lot* about Hazel.

The camera whipped back to frame Hazel's ebullient smile, "We're all the way out in – "

"The middle of nowhere," Lena called as she appeared in-frame behind Hazel, carrying the supplies to the front door of the cottage.

"– the woods," Hazel continued, undaunted, "spending the weekend at this reportedly haunted cottage to *commune with the dead*!  And make s'mores."

"Mostly s'mores," Lena called again, nearly dropping the box of wine trying to unlock the door.

"It's so weird, I'm not getting anything," Hazel had circled the interior of the cabin three times, camera in one hand and K2 in the other, while Lena prepared dinner. The EMF detector hadn't even flickered. Lena finished the dishes as Hazel added the bedroom and the bathroom to her exploration.

Outside, the weather had turned unexpectedly. Lena remembered weather reports calling for clear skies all weekend. Rain hammered the tiny windows and wooden walls as the wind buffeted the whole structure. A beast seeking a way in.

"Babe," Lena called from the couch.  "How about you take a break, huh? I got a fire going." Hazel would be disappointed if she didn't find any 'evidence' but Lena really wanted an evening with her girlfriend.

"We should greet them! The spirits get testy if we aren't respectful," Hazel announced as she returned, the camera and EMF detector nowhere to be seen. She cleared a space on the floor in front of the fireplace.

"You're thinking of my supervisor," Lena teased as she moved to the floor as well.

***

Sitting cross-legged on the floor opposite each other, with a small incense burner between them and a glass of wine each, the women began Hazel's *welcoming ritual*.

"We're hoping to communicate with anyone who may be here," Hazel began, glancing around the dark corners of the room. "My name's Hazel. This is Lena. We don't mean any disrespect." She shot Lena a warning look. *Don't scoff,* it said. *They won't like it,* it said.

"You're welcome here," they intoned together, a script Lena knew well. "You're welcome here," they repeated, and once more, then sipped their wine. Suddenly, an exceptionally powerful gust crashed around the cabin, throwing the front door wide and startling both women.

Hazel’s was jubilant!  "Hello? You're here? Thank you for that sign!"

Lena laughed as she ran to the door, making sure it was latched and bolted.  "Babe, it's a miracle this place is still standing! The wind blowing open a door isn't a sign from beyond."

Hazel offered a patient smile, "Well explain this!" She held up her forearm for Lena's inspection.  "Look! Goosebumps! It's freezing all of a sudden!"

Lena smirked and pulled Hazel into a gentle embrace.  "*I'll* give you goosebumps."

Giggling, Hazel draped her arms over Lena's shoulders, "But the spirits are watching!"

"Well, they can like and subscribe," Lena murmured, her lips meeting Hazel’s. Their kiss deepened as her tongue entered Hazel’s mouth. Hazel responded eagerly, pressing her hips against Lena’s and running her hands down Lena’s sides, tugging her shirt out of her jeans.

Lena moaned into Hazel's mouth, kissing her with a desperate passion as she slipped both hands down the back of Hazel's leggings.

"Babe!" Hazel pulled back, eyes wide enough to see the whites. "D'you feel that?"

Lena hesitated to admit it, but she had felt a strange tingle; probably the storm, the atmosphere, Hazel’s unwavering belief in the supernatural. Still, she *had* felt something. A little electric shock pulsing over their skin, not painful, just a pinch. 

"Static discharge? From the storm?" she guessed, grasping at rational explanations, though she knew she was just throwing out words.

"They like us!" Hazel's hands crept up Lena's back beneath her shirt as she called out to the 'spirits', "Thank you! For letting us know you're here!"

"C'mon, babe!" Lena murmured softly as she squeezed Hazel's perfectly shaped ass. "It's just us." But even as she said it, her voice lacked the usual certainty.

Hazel claimed Lena’s lips with a fierce, hungry kiss, tearing her shirt over her head and tossing it aside. Her tongue invaded Lena’s mouth with urgent need as her hands unhooked the back of Lena’s painfully practical "granny-bra." Hazel’s tongue tangled with Lena’s in a wild, drowning hunger, her lips trailing down to her neck before she grasped Lena’s full, inviting breasts. She squeezed once, then yanked Lena's bra off, exposing thick, dark nipples to the cool night air. "Babe," she breathed over Lena’s skin, her lips moving lower, to the sensitive curve of Lena’s left breast, where she suckled with teasing, possessive intent.

Lena gasped as an *incredibly* cold fingertip trailed down her bare back.  "Haze?" she whimpered softly.

Hazel smiled impishly, releasing the nipple just long enough to say, "It's just us," then quickly unbuttoned Lena's jeans and tugged them down around her knees.

The cabin shuddered, the wind buffeting it again and Lena was sure she'd heard voices – more than one – sighing happily beneath the gale. She opened her mouth to say something but lost her words as Hazel's lips pressed against the her pubic mound, then further down.

She could feel Hazel’s probing tongue pushing against her panties; her treasures beneath.

"Haaa~," Lena gasped, burying her hands in Hazel’s hair. She'd intended to speak but Hazel had exposed her pussy and began licking eagerly, back to front, curling her tongue inside with each pass.

Frigid, invisible fingers began teasing Lena's nipples.

Lena tightened her grip on Hazel’s hair, and Hazel took it as encouragement. She lapped harder, faster, soft moans of delight escaping her lips as she explored Lena’s depths.

"Haze," Lena gasped, her mind foggy with lust and a touch of panic over the *hands* now playing with her tits. Ghostly, icy hands that only heightened her arousal.

*MmmHMMM!* Hazel moaned into Lena's pussy, sending a thrumming wave through Lena's most sensitive parts.  She moved her hands to Lena's behind, giving each cheek a rough squeeze pulling her lover's crotch firmly against her face.

Lena made a sound that might have been the start of Hazel’s name or just a wordless whimper, but she was silenced by a kiss. Their unseen companion, one of them, at least, claimed Lena’s mouth. The lips against hers were like ice, but the tongue that sought out hers was warm and full of passion.

She lost herself then, sinking into the wonderful feelings of riding her girlfriend's face while ghostly hands played with her breasts and a ghostly mouth gave her a wildly passionate, longing kiss.

Other ghostly hands were on her thighs, on her back, and as one of those icy fingers grazed her labia then began probing gently at Lena's asshole, she broke.  Whimpering and trembling and squeezing her thighs as tight as she could against Hazel's head while the first, of many, orgasms crashed into her.

***

Lena lay tangled in the blankets they had pulled onto the floor, staring up at the ceiling with an expression of blissful disbelief. Hazel kissed her softly, then got up and ambled int the kitchen.  "Shit, the batteries are dead!"

Lena blinked slowly and pushed herself up on an elbow, a sleepy smile lingering on her face.   "What? Babe, were you recording that?"

Hazel blushed prettily and let out a shy laugh.  "I tried to! I didn’t think you were gonna, y’know, but yeah, of course I set up the tripod before we did the ritual."

Lena groaned softly, a warm flush spreading through her. "I'm on a sexorcism tape."

Hazel giggled as she rejoined Lena on the floor, curling close again.  "I’ll edit it very tastefully! It’s gonna be our first million likes."

They stayed there for a moment, wrapped in each other’s arms. The storm had passed and the night was silent all around. As Lena drifted off to sleep she thought she heard a voice from somewhere very far away.

*Thank you for letting us in.*
