"My name's Harper, you can call me Harper." That joke always got a few chuckles and a few groans, but Harper never gave up on it. _I'll marry the girl who laughs at that one,_ she’d joke to the other guides, who would invariably roll their eyes and change the subject.

"Today we're doing the Maple Song Loop. I *will* be singing later; if I get compliments, I'll bring you back!" More soft chuckles and she carried on, satisfied.  "It's a green trail, nothing difficult, but it's about five miles. Expect we'll be out for about three hours. That means your boots are laced tight–"

Harper kept going, sprinkling in easy jokes and light-hearted banter, but Alex’s attention drifted. It felt _so good_ to be out of the city! Away from her too-large apartment, the noise, the endless bullshit filling her days. _This is what I need,_ she thought. _A long walk in the woods, fresh air, and the colors of fall. It renews the soul._

As the guide was wrapping up, Alex struggled to recall what Harper had just said. _Harper, what a beautiful name!_ she thought, then giggled softly at her own silly smile. _Maybe she’ll have to rescue me,_ she mused, a playful thought from her high school fantasies—more than a decade ago now.

"Everyone still okay?" Harper asked the group – eight in total, including herself – as they reached the first lookout. There was a murmur of affirmation and Harper settled into her usual spiel. The view was stunning, but her favourite spot wasn’t on the tour today; too tough for your typical _leaf peeper_.

Her attention drifted to the woman at the back of the group. She looked outdoorsy in that "fresh off the rack" way; adorable. A city girl really _trying_ to fit in. Only a few years younger than herself, curvy in all the right places, practically giddy with excitement. Harper was pretty sure she’d heard her squeal when the wildlife got so close on this trail.

"Five minutes, then we move on to site two," Harper finished, as the others spread out, snapping pictures and reading the signage. She approached the woman, who was kneeling and tying her laces. Again. "New at this?" she teased gently, nodding at her untied laces – they’d come undone three times already.

"What?  Oh, no!  I don't know what it is about these stupid laces! They won't stay tied."

Harper smiled and crouched in front of her, "You're tying them wrong, City Girl." Harper's tone was playful, gentle, friendly teasing.  "Mind if I…?"

The woman looked momentarily confused, then blushed prettily and laughed, "Please!"

Harper took the laces, deliberately letting her fingertips brush linger on the back of City Girl's hand. "You alternate sides, top and bottom," she explained, showing her how a bow would stay secure or come loose. She looked up into the pretty brunette’s eyes and said, "Let me do the other one."

"Alex," the woman blurted.

"Hmm?"

"My name," she said, surprised at herself.  "It's Alex."

Now it was Harper's turn to blush, "Hi, Alex."

The sun edged toward the horizon as the group reached the trailhead parking lot. They were all rumpled and winded, but each took a moment to thank Harper, most promising to leave positive feedback. Harper smiled warmly, knowing most wouldn’t follow through, but every bit helped.

"This was _just_ what I needed!" Alex exclaimed as the others departed. Harper offered Alex her warmest smile. The last few hours had kept Alex close and Harper had been more than a little charmed by how genuine and enthusiastic this city girl seemed, even when she was clearly struggling with the exertion.

Harper’s gaze sharpened, confident and teasing. “I’m glad,” she said smoothly, wrapping her arms around Alex in a quick, warm hug. She’d guessed Alex wanted more than just a handshake. Alex hesitated for a moment, then returned the hug wight vigor.

When they parted, Harper caught the faintest blush and made up her mind. “It’s a shame we don’t get to visit my favourite spot,” she said softly. “You’d love it.”

Alex looked surprised. “Why doesn’t the tour go there?”

Harper’s smile deepened, confident and daring. “It’s not as easy as the Loop. And I wouldn’t take just anyone.”

Alex’s smile became a half-smirk. “Would you take me?”

"Show me your pack," Harper said playfully but with a hint of seriousness. She inspected the items Alex has packed, nodding at some, frowning at others, then carefully repacked it with a sunny smile. "Alright, you probably won’t die if we get separated."

A sudden fear washed over Alex; she paled. “Separated?”

Harper laughed and lightly touched Alex’s shoulder. “Relax! We won’t. But y’know… the people who _do_ get lost in the woods are the ones who don’t plan for it.” She took a deep breath, filling her lungs, and deliberately let her chest rise and fall, the crisp morning air making her cleavage look especially inviting. She exhaled slowly, fog curling in the cold air. The day would warm up, but right now, Alex wished Harper had told her to bring a jacket.

They followed the Maple Song Loop a few hundred yards past the first lookout point when Harper pointed into the brush.  "That way, that's our trail."

Alex peered sceptically at what could *possibly* be a trail, but could also be a slightly thin part of the trees.  She was about to ask Harper for reassurance but the taller woman was already disappearing between the branches.

A short distance into the new trail, Alex caught up. She was relieved to see the path soon became much clearer, marked by a blue diamond trail marker on a tree. "Split Oak Hollow," Harper called over her shoulder. "My little secret corner of the woods."

"R-really?" Alex managed, her face already heating from the exertion; this incline was steeper than Maple Song’s gentle slope and the cold morning air made her cheeks burn.

Harper chuckled softly as she glanced back. Alex suddenly felt a pang of self-consciousness, but also a strange thrill—_Maybe she really _will_ have to rescue me_.

"Don't worry, city girl, it's not far." Harper said, her tone light and teasing.

Alex tried to process her words, but her focus was broken as she realised how much Harper resembled that ponytailed adventurer from those video games. 

"What?" Alex gasped, voice breathy and shaky. _Are we climbing a mountain? It didn’t look steep!_

"About two hundred yards, then it levels out," Harper said with a playful laugh. She was walking _backward_—how was she navigating this _vertical cliff_ backwards?!

"Oh–kay," Alex panted staring at her feet.

"I'm gonna **die**," Alex groaned, pressing the heel of her palm hard into her side just below her ribs.

Harper laughed again and moved close – intoxicatingly so – murmuring, "Nobody dies on my hikes.  Look."

Alex looked.

She'd heard a waterfall since they left the Loop, but now they'd arrived. Somewhere above, a river spilled over a cliff, gathered in a pool here, then tumbled over the side and vanished below. Mist rose from the waterfall, catching the morning light; air itself strung with diamonds. Ahead was a sheer drop with a breathtaking view of a wide valley ablaze with red and gold.

Alex felt like she'd stepped into a storybook.

"Worth it?" Harper asked softly, standing very close behind her. When Alex turned to face her guide, no words came, only a nervous _mm-hmm_.

Harper’s hands rested gently on Alex’s hips, then she leaned in a little closer. Alex was suddenly acutely aware of Harper's clean, simple scent. Soap, shampoo, beeswax lip balm. Harper smelled … uncomplicated. It was unbearably attractive.

"Okay?" Harper asked softly.  Alex didn't respond with words. Instead, she closed the distance and kissed Harper fiercely, both hands grabbing her behind. Harper’s hands moved slowly from Alex’s hips, slipping under her jacket, up her back until she felt ridges of Alex’s bra through her thin shirt. Alex moaned into Harper’s mouth, pressing her hips hard against Harper’s jeans. Harper didn’t break the kiss, she just paused, lips still against Alex’s, and softly laughed.

"Been holding back, city girl."

***

Harper had spread a thick wool blanket over the bare rock, settling herself comfortably with her legs stretched out before her. Alex hesitated for a moment, then knelt down beside her, breath catching.

"Harper…?" she whispered, voice trembling.

Harper chuckled softly, trembling fingers grazing brushing her skin. "Yeah, city girl? Amazing view, huh?"

Alex’s voice was almost a plea. "I want you to see me." Her heart hammered in her chest, loud and frantic, and she wondered if Harper could hear it. If she hadn’t been so nervous, she might have laughed at the fiery, eager look on her guide’s face.

Harper’s eyes darkened, a slow, knowing smile curling her lips. "I see you," she purred, low and inviting, before leaning in just enough to ignite the spark.

***

Goosebumps rose on Alex's skin as Harper undressed her. Harper was gentle, almost reverent, carefully placing each piece of Alex's clothing at the edge of the blanket. Her gaze danced over Alex's body and back to her face, her mouth, her eyes. "Beautiful," Harper breathed. The cold morning air stung Alex's skin, but Harper's touch felt like fire.

Then, somehow, Alex was nude, both hands on Harper's shoulders. They kissed, messy and clumsy with need, tongues and teeth and loud moans; when Harper squeezed Alex's buttocks, she shivered all over. Alex somehow maintained the kiss as she shifted on the blanket, straddling Harper's thigh and pressing herself down on her guide's denim-covered leg.

Breaking the kiss, Harper gazed into Alex's eyes as her fingers moved down Alex's body. She found Alex's clit, then slid further down along Alex's folds. Alex gasped and clutched Harper's flannel shirt as if it were a lifeline, rocking her hips, grinding against Harper's fingers and her thigh. The contrast made Alex whimper; the icy morning biting her shoulders, Harper’s touch igniting her from within. She rocked harder and was sure she heard Harper _oh-oh-ohhh_ in response.

“Let go,” Harper whispered, steady, confident, fingers deep inside as the morning sun kissed Alex in places it had never before seen. "I've got you, Alex."

She did. Hearing her name on Harper's lips pushed her over the most wonderful peak. Pleasure ripped through her, sudden and fierce, her body arching, her cry stifled as she buried her face in Harper's neck. The morning air was sharp in her lungs, her skin flushed and glowing.

When it ebbed, she slumped forward, sweat dampening Harper’s shirt. For the first time, she didn’t care how she looked, didn’t care who she was supposed to be. She was warm, sated, and free.
