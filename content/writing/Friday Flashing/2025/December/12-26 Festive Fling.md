Eleanor stood before the floor-to-ceiling windows in her apartment living room. The snow piled up on the balcony, and below, the city twinkled with a festive glow. She savoured a slow sip from the short-stemmed wine glass, delighting in the sweet, creamy texture. The eggnog flowed smoothly over her tongue and into her throat. The glass, with its squat, heavy body and square-ish bowl with a gold rim, was a ridiculous bit of nostalgia for her. The side of the glass featured two colourful stripes, one red and one green, topped with a ring of holly and berries. A childhood holdover, the glasses made the holiday feel somehow *more* special when she drank eggnog from them.

She heard a quiet movement behind her, but didn't turn, not yet. Instead, she gazed at her ghostly reflection in the window, the city lights casting an ethereal glow. She kept herself in excellent shape exactly for nights like tonight. Her long, dark brown hair was tucked behind her ears, and a playful Santa cap held it in place, adding a touch of whimsy to her overall look. Her only other attire was a sleek, red leather bunny suit—sans puffy tail—which showcased the swell of her bust and the curve of her behind in a deliberate, tantalising way. A thick, black leather belt with a shiny gold buckle cinched at her waist, complementing her knee-high, shiny black leather boots. Each boot was held tight at the top, snugged against her thigh with its own shiny gold buckle.

After a prolonged moment, she turned, offering her beautiful young guest a faint, enigmatic smile. The sight of Heidi made her heart soar, but she kept her excitement in check. Not yet, that was for later.

Heidi, the pretty redhead, had shed her buttoned-down, overly serious classroom persona tonight. Eleanor recalled how earnest and driven *that* Heidi had been when they first met. Eleanor had given a Journalistic Ethics lecture at Ashford College and this brilliant young woman had waited for her afterward, eager to debate many of Eleanor's assertions. She knew immediately that she must *possess* this girl.

Things had gone *remarkably* well, better than Eleanor had dared hope that first day.

Heidi stood exceptionally still, her shoulders squared and chin slightly lowered, just as Eleanor had taught her. Her hands rested on her bare thighs in a pose of subtle, patient submission. Perfect. 

Her rice-paper-thin green teddy—one of several Christmas gifts from Eleanor this year—clung to her curves, perfectly complementing her petite frame. The delicate fabric seemed to glow in the light, and Heidi's skin radiated a warm, golden undertone. The unlined top of the teddy provided a subtle lift to Heidi's delicate, champagne-glass-shaped breasts, accentuating their gentle curves. The front panel covered her torso, but the sheer fabric revealed more than it concealed, leaving her sides, waist, and hips completely bare. The teddy's open bottom was an invitation, and Eleanor's gaze lingered on the exposed skin. Heidi was *stunning*.

"I have good news and bad news, Elf," Eleanor said softly, using her 'in charge' voice. Eleanor's commanding tone was unmistakable, and Heidi's body responded instinctively, her muscles tensing in anticipation of what was to come. However, Heidi knew better than to speak out of turn, and she remained silent as she awaited further instruction. The air was thick with anticipation, and Heidi's silence was a testament to her training and devotion to Eleanor

"The bad news is that one of *Santa's* reindeer can't work this year, so I will have to find a replacement. Fortunately, that leads me to the good news." Eleanor approached Heidi with the deliberate slowness of a cat stalking its prey, her heels clicking out a rhythmic pattern on the hardwood floor. The sound seemed to echo through the room. "The good news, *Elf*, is Santa has one more gift for you."

With a subtle movement, Eleanor used the toe of her boot to slowly slide a box from under the sofa. She left it at Heidi's feet, the beautifully wrapped gift reflecting the warm lighting of the room.

"You can open it."

Heidi squatted slowly, then knelt, just the way Eleanor had taught her, and carefully opened the box, the lid creaking as it opened. The label on the top seemed to gleam in the light, the words 'PROPERTY OF SANTA' emblazoned on it a promise. Inside the box, a bed of red silk cradled the contents. In the centre, a beautifully crafted under-bust harness lay waiting, the smooth brown leather gleaming with a subtle sheen. The harness was adorned with gleaming gold studs, and a bright red lace-up corset seemed to pulse with a vibrant energy. A row of three gleaming brass bells lined each side of the harness. A matching silicone bit-gag accompanied the harness, featuring a bell on each side, with a strap made of matching brown leather. At the bottom of the box, a candy-cane striped strapless strap-on lay waiting, prominently labelled 'For Santa's Use Only!'.

"Try it on, *Reindeer*," Eleanor said, her voice slow and husky as she loomed over the kneeling girl, a hint of a smile playing on her lips. Heidi stood up without hesitation. She carefully slipped out of her lingerie, and Eleanor couldn't help but gasp softly at the sight of her sub's enthralling beauty. As Heidi began to struggle into the harness, Eleanor's eyes never left her. She watched Heidi's squirming with amusement, her eyes glinting with pleasure. "Would you like some help, Reindeer? It's only your first day, I know."

Heidi's eyes met Eleanor's, and the look of giddy excitement that sparkled there was almost too much. She felt a laugh rising up, but suppressed it, not wanting to break the spell. *What an incredible girl!*

"Yes, please, Mis–*Santa*." Heidi caught herself almost in time; tonight's play was different, and she had to remember new things.

Eleanor took her time securing Heidi into the harness. She spoke in a cool, clinical tone, her words a steady stream as she announced each buckle, as if she were performing an inspection, her fingers moving with precision as she worked. As she finished cinching the last buckle, the one that held the harness snugly around Heidi's waist, a shiver ran through Heidi's thighs, a hint of her growing arousal that didn't go unnoticed.

Eleanor took her time lacing the corset, her fingers moving with deliberate slowness. Once it was secured, she ran her fingertips over the whole affair, her touch light and teasing. Then, she cupped Heidi's breasts briefly, her palms cradling them possessively. The sub's sharp intake of breath and the stiffness of her nipples gave Eleanor all the confirmation she needed.

"Good, you're almost ready," Eleanor said as she bent down and retrieved the bit-gag from the box. "All we have left is this." Eleanor stood behind Heidi, her hips brushing against the girl's bare ass cheeks. She brought the gag over Heidi's head, holding it before her mouth with a silent insistence. Heidi opened wide and Eleanor placed the bit inside, then tightened the straps until she was certain Heidi wouldn't be able to properly close her mouth or talk for the duration.

"Perfect," Eleanor intoned, sounding satisfied as she stepped back to inspect her handiwork. "But listen closely, Reindeer," Eleanor said, her voice taking on a stern tone. "A noisy reindeer will wake the children and spoil Christmas. You need to move with precision, or you don't move at all. Understood?"

A small pearl of drool had already formed on Heidi's lower lip. She nodded, causing both the bells on her bit and at her side to jingle softly. Heidi's eyes widened in surprise, her face a picture of shock as she realised the noise she had made. "Uhh-huh-whah." *Understood.*

"What a good reindeer you are. Now let's begin your training. Down." Eleanor had to turn away to hide her smile as Heidi carefully got down on all fours. The jingling of the bells, the creak of the straps and leather, and Heidi's own very loud breathing all combined to create a symphony of sound that thrilled the domme. "That was terrible," Eleanor said, turning back, in control of herself again. "The family dog is barking his head off at all that racket."

Eleanor slowly began to circle Heidi, taking in the sight of her sub on her hands and knees. Heidi made *such* a pretty picture, her breasts hanging free, her skin aglow. She was completely naked from the waist down, and Eleanor couldn't help but feel a surge of desire at the sight. As Eleanor circled Heidi, her fingertips slid over her sub's skin, tracing the curves of her body. She lingered for a long moment behind Heidi. Her legs were spread wide enough apart that Eleanor could admire Heidi's firm, plump ass, but also her pink folds between her legs. They glistened a little, already slick with arousal. Below that, Eleanor caught sight of the thick, orange pubic hair she had told Heidi to grow out.

Heidi's left thigh twitched.

"Are you getting tired, Reindeer? You woke up the family dog, and now you need to stay perfectly still. No sounds out of your bells, no matter what. You need to wait until the dog stops barking." Eleanor very slowly caressed Heidi's ass cheeks, tracing the curves of her body. She let her fingertips follow the gap up to Heidi's tailbone, her touch light and teasing. "You told me you understood, Reindeer. I'm sure the dog will get bored soon, and then you can move again."

One minute.

Two.

Heidi began to make a pained sound, the noise muffled by the bit in her mouth. Drool pooled on the floor beneath her, a testament to her growing discomfort. Eleanor watched, fascinated, as Heidi's thighs and ass twitched and shuddered. The lactic acid must have been building up, and Eleanor could see the tension in the sub's body.

Four.

"I think he's almost tired himself out," Eleanor announced, her voice a near monotone. She had retrieved another of their toys, a feather duster, and Eleanor began stroking the insides of Heidi's thighs with it. Eleanor's self-control slipped the tiniest bit, and she found herself running the feathers over Heidi's pussy. It was pink and swollen with need, and Eleanor could see the dew collecting in Heidi's pubic hair. The sub *moaned* in desperation and moved back against the duster. She was practically *presenting*, but she did it with such slow and careful movements that not a single bell made a sound. Eleanor was amazed.

"Very good, Reindeer," Eleanor said, standing up slowly and feeling a little light-headed at her own excitement. Excitement *and* overwhelming feelings of love, admiration, and connection. "You may move again, if you like."

She allowed herself a steadying breath, then another, before turning her attention back to Heidi, who was standing again and facing Eleanor, in the preferred pose; shoulders squared (*We don't do shame, we don't do meek, we do proudly respectful.*) and eyes slightly downcast. "The next training task, we're going to practise following instructions. Stand at the windows, face the city."

As Heidi walked to the windows, standing almost exactly where Eleanor had, there was barely more than a whisper from the bells. *She learns so quickly, she always tries so very hard.* "Stop there. Now, you'll do as I say, but you'll do it as evenly as possible. No bells, no rush, *precision* in every movement. Understood?"

A slobbery sucking sound came from Heidi before she responded. "Uhh-huh-whah." *Understood.*

"Stand tall, hands on hips." Eleanor started her with something easy.

"Touch your toes." The bells whispered again, but Eleanor ignored it in favour of admiring Heidi's bare bottom, her exposed slit and her beautiful, long legs.

"Squat." This was more difficult still, but Heidi had been practising, not just in their sessions. Eleanor had her hold the position for nearly a minute as she retrieved the "For Santa's Use Only" device.

"Knees," Eleanor's voice was sharper this time, less controlled. She was certain Heidi would notice, but no matter, she would know why soon.

"Stand, heel-turn to face me." This time there was a faint jingle out of some of the bells along Heidi's side, but their game was nearly at an end. She was sitting on the sofa, in the middle, with the strapless strap-on rising comically up from between Eleanor's legs. The large bulb that held it in place was deep, deep inside Eleanor.

"Do you want to go for a ride on the sleigh, Reindeer?"

Heidi nodded eagerly, drool trailing from her lips all over her chest. "Yuth, plah, Sanha."

"Come for a ride, then," Eleanor beckoned her over. Heidi moved with the same precision as before, threatening to destroy Eleanor's willpower, but as she lowered herself onto the fat, fake cock, Heidi's eyes grew wide. It was bigger than anything they'd used before, but Eleanor knew her pet was ready. "Ride. Enjoy yourself, Reindeer."

Eleanor's voice was low, throaty with desire and she didn't bother to stifle her moans as Heidi began bouncing. The thick bulb deep inside Eleanor slid and ground and thrust in response to Heidi's every twitch.

Eleanor's hands moved to Heidi's perfect little tits, caressing each, smearing Heidi's own drool all over the exposed skin, then she gave each nipple a sharp pinch and a little twist. In response Heidi's belly flexed and rolled and her hips drove the dildo deeper into Eleanor than she'd thought it could go. In her silly Santa-domme boots, Eleanor's toes clenched and flexed as her own pent-up desire barrelled toward release.

*No! Not first!* Eleanor thought wildly, watching Heidi's perfect body, watching her soulmate, fuck herself madly on the ridiculous, candy-cane-striped silicone dong that ground and squirmed inside her own hot passage. She released Heidi's left nipple and brought her hand down. She locked eyes with her sub as her thumb navigated Heidi's dense orange thatch and then attended her clit. She circled, stroked, pressed, never losing contact as Heidi whimpered and twitched and dribbled spittle everywhere.

They didn't climax together, Eleanor wasn't able to manage that, but the way Eleanor's climax crashed through her body, sent her into very un-domme-like squeals of delight, was enough to push Heidi over her edge. Within seconds the two women, the lovers, were connected by pure, animal bliss.

***

"Heidi, dear, where are you?" Eleanor was using her *lover* voice now. This voice didn't command, didn't instruct; this one confessed and praised and encouraged. Sometimes, only sometimes, it hoped—hoped it could be like this forever.

They were still tangled on the couch, the strapless strap-on still inside them both, both basking in the blush-pink afterglow of their shared lovemaking.

Heidi was slumped against Eleanor, her face buried in her domme's neck. After a very long pause she replied softly, "Home."
