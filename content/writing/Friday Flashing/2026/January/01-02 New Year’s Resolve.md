"FOUR!" the party chanted in unison.

"Yeah, but what's  your naaaaaaame?" Rhiannon slurred, spilling her drink without noticing.

"THREE!"

"I tol' ya already! Trystan." He was **gorgeous**—square jaw, swarthy, all angles and muscle, with the sort of dark stubble Rhiannon wanted to absolutely *grind* against.

"TWO!"

"No, you din't! Tell me!"

The pillar of pure manliness before her stumbled a little and shook his head. "Nah! Tell me yours first!"  She imagined climbing him like a tree.

"ONE!"

"Shuddup!" Rhiannon grabbed his shirt with both hands, completely forgetting the champagne she'd been holding only seconds before. "Fuckin' *kiss* me!"

***

The morning sun had the utter *gall* to shine directly onto Rhiannon's face, dragging her back to the waking world like she was a toddler at the candy rack and it was her mum.

"Where's my fuckin'—" her thoughts crashed to a halt. *Everything? Aw, fuck.*  The night came back to her: Cassie's New Year's Eve party, the cocktails, the *pot*, the **shots**!

… the guy?

She shifted in the county-sized bed and looked around the room. She was completely naked, of course, and dangling from one of the blinds was her shiny pink (*crotchless!*) panties. Her tiny tube-dress was in a heap by the door to the en-suite bathroom. No sign of her stockings, shoes or coat.

She'd decided a bra would only spoil the fun last night, so at least she didn't have to find that.

She groaned, piecing more of it together: too many drinks, impending panic over being alone at midnight, that hot guy appeared out of nowhere. Her body ached in the best way; her pussy sore and sticky from whatever wild shit they'd done last night.

Where was the guy?

The *fuck* was his name?

Were the sheets made of pure *cloud* or something?  She'd never felt anything so soft and smooth against her skin.

"Good morning!"

Whirling as best she could while naked and sitting in the middle of a larger-than-king-size-bed on the kind of sheets Rhiannon imagined literal fuckin' *royalty* might sleep on, she pulled the overstuffed duvet up to her neck.  For all the good it would do.  Memories from last night and their little 'after-party' were flooding back to her now and letting him have a good look at her tits in the morning light would be maybe the *tamest* thing she'd done since meeting—

"Trystan!" Thank *FUCK* she'd found his name before it got *really* awkward.  "H-hi.  Good morning.  Hi?"  Rhiannon's head hammered and she thought she wanted to puke, but her tummy also did a girlish little flip-flop at the sight of him standing in the doorway.

He was tall. Fit, but not muscular, with the most *perfect* little swirl of pitch-black hair on his chest between his pectorals. He wore only a pair of thin, cotton pyjama pants that left *no doubt* he was going commando. He looked *weathered* but also perfectly polished.

"You remembered my name," he said affably. "That's pretty great."  He chuckled as he entered the bedroom, a Greek statue come to life.  "I, um, I made breakfast."

*Holy shit! He's shy!* Rhiannon thought wildly, and the butterflies in her stomach had moved further south.

"It's just coffee and scones."  He sounded apologetic as he approached the bed, carrying his tray bearing a thermal carafe, two mugs, an earthenware cream pitcher, and a plate laden with golden brown squares embedded with peach chunks and covered in a frosting drizzle.

"I'll get you a car if—" his comical earnestness after *last night* threatened Rhiannon with a giggle fit, but she knew *that* would ruin everything that might come next.  Her crotch throbbed with growing eagerness at the thoughts of what might be next.

He was big.  She remembered that.  Like, gasping-for-air big.

It'd be stupid to leave now, right?

Putting on her most casual, "bad-girl" air, she offered him what she hoped was a lusty smile. "It's New Year's Day, where do I gotta be?" She lifted the duvet away from the bed—an open invitation—revealing her modest breasts, small nipples, and raspberry-dotted areola.

Trystan looked shocked, then chuckled, handing her a mug. His eyes raked over her as if he wanted to devour her right there. The coffee burned her tongue, rich and bold; the scones flaky and warm, crumbs and warm peach chunks tumbling down her chest. She licked her lips slowly, watching him watch her.

"Somethin' I don't recall from last night," she began, finishing her scone and washing it down with a mouthful of hot, bitter coffee. "I don't remember gettin' a proper *taste* for myself." Rhiannon's fingers brushed the patch of hair on his chest, then slid down, between his abdomen and his pants, finding the thick, *wonderful* warmth between his legs. "You put it all somewhere else, didn’ya?"

Curling her fingers around him, she squeezed, stroking, fascinated by the feel of his skin. Not _clean_, not at all; his cock was coated in a sticky, slightly _grippy_ film—her own dried juices. Rhiannon had marked him; he _belonged_ to her now.

The ache surged again, heat pooling between her thighs, her filthy mind already racing. No way was she leaving without round two. She released him, set aside the breakfast, and raked her nails lightly over his abs. "I'm gettin' down on the floor over there and *you're* gonna fuck my pretty mouth. Okay?"

She slipped from the bed, blushing a little herself as she stood fully on display, noting the way his attention settled on her waist, then her hips, then her slit—freshly shaved just before the party last night—and shook her head.

"Nuh, uh. Maybe for dessert." She knelt on the floor and opened her mouth wide, waiting.

He hesitated again; she didn't think he was used to taking such blunt direction. She gave him a smirk. "Trystan, get over here and _fuck my face_!"

She sat on the floor, her sopping wet pussy leaving a smear across the wood, arching her back to present her mouth and modest tits as an offering. She wanted to be below his cock, so he could use her throat from above. The position felt exposed, animalistic—exactly how she craved it—her offering a willing, wet hole and asking nothing in return but to provide **primal** gratification.

He responded quickly to her second command, shoving down his pyjama pants with the force of a dam bursting. His cock bounced free, already leaking pre-cum. He *was* thick. And long. With a slight curve toward the tip she didn't recall from the previous night.

"Oh fuck, yeah!" Rhiannon breathed, then opened wide for him.

He climbed out of bed and took the two steps he needed to be standing right over her. The heat from his dick, the smell of his body, and the lingering scent of their fucking the night before filled Rhiannon with desperate need. She didn't wait for him to take the lead, instead catching his cock with her mouth and drove it down until he bottomed out at the back of her throat.

"Fuck!" he gasped, sounding utterly shocked. He started to pull back, but Rhiannon drove her nails deep into his ass-cheeks and pulled him hard against her face once more. Tears welled as she struggled to relax, as she pulled him harder still, as she tried to force him down her throat.

Then she felt his fingers in her hair, gripping her tight and she nearly climaxed from that alone.

"Uuuh, kay," Trystan said, mostly t0 himself, and pulled back—pulled Rhiannon away by her hair—and began pumping into her mouth. The first few strokes were slower than Rhiannon would've liked, but the way he was pulling her hair more than made up for it.

She encouraged him with her tongue, rolling and flexing, curling it against the underside, fluttering against the tip each time he nearly pulled out.

"Your fucking *mouth*," he groaned as he rammed his cock back in, causing Rhiannon to snort and twist a little on the floor. "Fucking *hell*!" He slammed against the back of her throat again, and Rhiannon stifled a gag. "Mouth *made* for dick!"

Rhiannon made a whimpering sound she hoped sounded like agreement, but the way he was thrusting, the way he was slightly pulling her head to one side or the other with each attack, she knew he didn’t need any more encouragement.

"I bet—" *thrust* "—you got—" *thrust* "—cock—" *THRUST* "—in here—" *thrust-thrust* "—all the—" ***THRUST*** "—time!" He was *in*!

Rhiannon shuddered beneath his rough usage of her mouth and those _words_. She was holding one tit, squeezing and kneading it, and rubbing her clit furiously with two fingers, but the moment he finally entered her throat, she stopped completely. She gagged once, managed to control it, then waited for the real fun to begin.

"FUCK!" Trystan howled. "Tight!" He managed again, then yanked Rhiannon’s face off his throbbing cock only to bury it back down her throat again. Rhiannon gagged again, snorted again, and went back to masturbating on the floor while he used her head.

Again and again, he pounded her mouth; Rhiannon’s only sounds now were labored, desperate breathing, the wet sounds of her fingering her cunt, and the '*gwack*' she made as he face-fucked her faster and harder still.

Finally, mercifully, just as she began to fear she might pass out—it was _so_ hard to breathe like this—Trystan let out a growling wail. His smooth, shaven balls rested on Rhiannon’s chin, and he shot load after load of his hot cum directly down her throat. She tried to focus on milking him, but by now, she was cumming as well, sitting in a little puddle of her own sweat, spit, and sex juices.

***

The sun had left the bedroom, well on its way to its zenith, while Trystan and Rhiannon snuggled once more under the duvet.

"Hey." Rhiannon's voice was soft with a hint of mirth.

Trystan said nothing, just made a quiet, questioning 'mmm' sound.

"I still didn't get proper a taste. You're gonna need to try again."
