I decided that since I'm doing a few different series' these days (though mostly my Friday Flashing ones at the moment, since it's kind of a challenge to be sure I get something out every week!) I thought it'd be neat to have a different series image for each and that way the block of "other posts" at the bottom of the page has a bit more variety.

So, to that  end, I've got these four images, they're all public domain and eventually I want to replace them with commissioned art, but I think it's an okay first step.

<div class="image-refs">
