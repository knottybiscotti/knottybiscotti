Okay. Here we go.

Over on BlueSky I [formally declared](https://bsky.app/profile/knottybiscotti.bsky.social/post/3lzybpswwdc2b) that I'm going to try to write one short, spicy story a week for the next 52 weeks and share them out to the world.  I think I can do this?  My intent with the #friday_flashing tag is to *really* write flash fiction.  The trick with me is to say what I want to say in fewer words, not more.  I've always been fascinated by flash fiction but when my friend over on BlueSky, [xxxzilu](https://bsky.app/profile/xxxzilu.bsky.social), the amazing artist and all around wonderful person who helped me bring [Essa](/tags/essa_stiik) mentioned doing something for #Sexytember it really kind of took over my brain.  I don't expect I'm going to succeed with this crazy endeavour, but I'm going to succeed this week.

Then I'll see about next week.
