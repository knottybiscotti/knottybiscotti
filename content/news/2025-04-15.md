Well here we go! I'm finally satisfied with the presentation of the pages, or at least I'm satisfied enough to stop obsessing about it and that I will be able to easily change stuff down the road.

So now I've 'published' my first story, *Love Your Work*.  You can find it on the sidebar under *Essa Stiik*.  It should be easy to find, it's the only one there right now. This story is about one of my characters, Essa, who is relatively new in the pantheon of characters I dream up (and usually promptly forget about), but she's inhabiting a very, **very** old setting I created with a friend when I was in university. That setting didn't really go anywhere but I've really liked most of the elements and so when my friend [Zimaja](https://linktr.ee/zimaja) started asking me about it and about Essa, I kind of realised that Essa actually belongs in that setting.

So there we go, slightly reworked, a ton of lore, some I might share, some probably won't ever see the light of day, but who knows?  I do love writing and I have a few other works on the go right now, so maybe I'll actually keep this place up to date?  I hope so!

😘
