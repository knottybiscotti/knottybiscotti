Very short update this time, I really am going back to writing soon!  The thing is there were little fiddly things I wasn't happy with about my site and about how things are being rendered.  I also was kind of irritated that I couldn't get the [Acceptable Use Policy](/aup/) and [Copyright](/license/) stuff to display correctly.  Stuff like that … well, when you're autistic (or at least when you're the flavour of autistic I am) "good enough" is roughly the same as "dark matter".  There's a lot of very solid evidence to suggest it's a real thing, but it might also be completely made up nonsense.  So, yeah, had to fix stuff.  Again.  It's not totally fixed here now, but I'm pretty sure I can live with things the way they are now.  Unless I start up a new web browser and discover the pages look like poo.

It's difficult to let stuff go, I'm working on it.
