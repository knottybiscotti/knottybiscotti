## Community Guidelines

Welcome to *Knotty Biscotti's (sometimes) Naughty Treats*! I'm thrilled to have you here! This is a space for me to share my writing and for everyone who to enjoy it.  It'd be even better if you (yet *you*!) decide to participate too!  My writing pages and my updates have a section at the bottom for you to leave comments.  It's powered by Disqus since that seems to be the sweet spot right now for me to allow comments without having to maintain a whole bunch of things on my side. To keep this community positive, respectful, and productive, please take a moment to review and follow these guidelines.

### 1. **Respect each other**

- Treat all members with respect, kindness, and empathy.
- No bullying, harassment, hate speech, targeting, or personal attacks will be tolerated. We all make mistakes and say things that come out different than intended, I understand, so if someone gets upset about something you say here, please be quick to apologise. If you don't, I'm going to have to delete the comment(s) and if you keep it up you won't be allowed to participate anymore. Please just be nice to everyone.
- Avoid language or behaviour that might be offensive or discriminatory to others based on race, gender, sexuality, nationality, religion, politics, or any other personal characteristic.

### 2. **Keep conversations productive and constructive**

- Share feedback, ideas, and discussions in a constructive manner.
- Stay on-topic in discussion threads, and start new threads for different topics.
- Encourage others and celebrate each other‚Äôs successes.
- Please do not promote your own hustles of whatever form and please don't spam.

### 3. **Maintain a safe and inclusive environment**

- Respect privacy and never share anyone‚Äôs personal or confidential information.
- Please don't post any illegal content, link to any such content or provide instructions on how to access such content.
- Ensure that content you share is safe for all members to view and engage with.

### 4. **Promote positive engagement**

- Aim to add value with your comments, questions, and feedback.
- Like or react to posts that you find helpful, encouraging a positive atmosphere.
- Respect the opinions of others, even if you disagree.
- Address disagreements constructively and avoid escalating conflicts.

### 5. **No self-promotion or unsolicited advertising**

- Please stick to discussion and connection, not self-promotion.
- Do not promote your products, services, or external links unless it‚Äôs relevant to the page or active discussion you're responding to
- For those looking to collaborate, please just shoot me a message through one of the contact methods on the side-bar.

### 6. **Be mindful of intellectual property**

- Respect copyrights, trademarks, and other intellectual property rights.  Unless otherwise stated, everything I write here is published under the *Creative Commons Attribution, NonCommercial, ShareAlike 4.0 International License*.

### 7. **Reporting issues**

- If you see content or behaviour that goes against these guidelines, report it to our moderation team.  There's a button right there at the bottom of the comments.
- If you have any concerns or suggestions for improvement please let me know.

### 8. **Consequences for violating guidelines**

- Violations of these guidelines may lead to removal of content, temporary suspension, or even permanent removal from the community.
- Repeated violations or severe breaches of guidelines will be handled with stricter actions to ensure the safety and integrity of the community.

### 9. **Have fun and enjoy!**
