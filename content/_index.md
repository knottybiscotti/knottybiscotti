Hello there! Thanks for stopping by, I'm still moving in but there's a few things maybe you can look at while you're here.  Check over on the side.

I love writing, I've been making up my own stories as far back as I can remember, and I've got a head full of characters that want me to tell *their* stories. The best of those you'll be able to find here.  Enjoy yourself, but be warned, a lot of them are likely to be a bit piquant!

If you somehow found your way here and it *wasn't* from BlueSky, you should find me on [BlueSky](https://bsky.app/profile/knottybiscotti.bsky.social). That's the only social media I use at the moment (though I am on [Mastodon](https://universeodon.com/@kbray), but I haven't used it for literally anything).  I am also on Ko-Fi, so maybe I'll also be around there once in a while.  I have to be up front about it, I'm not the most reliable person you'll ever meet, so it's hard to know for sure where you'll find me.  If you find me.  I'm on Discord too, but that's a secret, don't tell anyone!  The links over there on the left will connect you to me!

Now I really don't like this part but it's best to get it right up front.  If you decide to react or comment on stuff here using the comment widget, that'd be **amazing** but also you should understand the [Acceptable Use Policy](legal/Acceptable_Use_Policy.md).  I tried to write it up in the nicest way possible and to make it clear that I consider "acceptable use" as "don't be a jerk".  We should all be fine.  Also, if you like what you read here and want to share it somewhere else or with friends, that'd be **even more amazing**!  My copyright terms are over in the [License](legal/License.md) page.  I think they're pretty fair.  If you don't, please just let me know!
